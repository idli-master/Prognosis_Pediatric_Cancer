Clinical, treatment and outcome data on 1,039 pediatric cancer patients whose molecular profile was characterized on OncoKids gene panel at Children's Hospital Los Angeles was abstracted and harmonized for submission to the NCI's Cancer Data Service. The OncoKids panel was designed to detect DNA mutations and amplification in almost 200 oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, a limited number of pharmacogenomic targets and 1,700 disease-associated gene fusions at the RNA level. The panel encompasses the vast majority of FDA's relevant pediatric molecular target list, as well as additional genes associated with ultra-rare pediatric tumors. The final data elements included DNA/RNA sequence data, OncoKids test results, clinical data on demographics, diagnosis, comorbidity and adverse events and treatment data.","GRU","1","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs002518.v1.p1"

Most genomic studies to-date, however, have focused on single diagnostic samples. Consequently our understanding of the clonal and genetic evolution of disease progression and metastasis remains limited. We set out to deliver a detailed characterization of clonal architecture of HR-NB during disease evolution and identify the biological pathways important for progression. We studied 470 sequential and spatially separated samples from 283 patients. This particular dbGAP study contains data from 182 tumors from 68 invididuals. For 30 individuals (72 tumors with WGS and 70 tumors with RNA-seq) raw WGS/RNA-seq data and somatic mutation calls are available. For 38 individuals (n=110 tumors) somatic mutation calls are available.","HMB","1","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs003111.v1.p1"

This supplement data from the Beat AML program provides Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA) and pediatric tumor specimens not previously released. These data include exome and RNA level characterization as well as analyses of ex vivo drug sensitivity. Collectively, this data can be leveraged to address clinical, genomic, transcriptomic and functional analyses of the biology of leukemia in pediatric and AYA populations.","GRU","1","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs002599.v1.p1"

The PPTC seeks to develop robust biomarkers of anticancer drug activity, and the majority of these are predicted to be genetic mutations that can be detected in tumor DNA and/or RNA. In order to design the most impactful experiments that can be rapidly translated to the clinic, PPTC investigators require a complete genomic characterization of the patient-derived xenograft tumor models that are utilized across the consortium. This will not only allow for the most robust experimental design, but also will increase the engagement of industry partners who seek collaborators poised to provide the proof-of-concept necessary for drugs in their development pipelines. All data and models will be made available to academically qualified investigators.","GRU","1","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs001437.v1.p1"
"phs002430","phs002430","['phs002430']","Genomic Analysis in Pediatric Malignancies","CCDI-UCSF-phs002430","Pediatric solid tumors are highly heterogeneous, encompassing a large number of histotypes. The genomic landscape of these diseases is characterized by few singleucleotide variants (SNVs) compared to adult cancers. In contrast, many exhibit a high prevalence of structural or epigenetic changes that alter gene expression, underlining the need for comprehensive genomic approaches such as whole-genome sequencing (WGS).

Several studies have specifically addressed the clinical utility of genomic analysis in the pediatric and AYA cancer setting. Review of these studies point to key challenges that must be addressed in order to advance the routine use of genomics in this population.

We have established a large collection of solid tumor tissue samples through our biobanking efforts. Where possible, we obtain longitudinal samples from the same patient. These primary patient samples and their corresponding germline have been analyzed using whole genome and whole transcriptome sequencing methods and have been linked to clinical metadata using both manual curation and robust methods for automatic extraction from the electronic health record (EHR). Importantly, research-grade genomic analysis is performed in parallel to our CLIA-grade sequencing (“UCSF500”) efforts described in the companion P30 supplement for clinical data sharing. For our sequenced tumor samples, we have retrospective clinical data and ongoing efforts to prospectively record key events throughout the patient’s cancer journey. In our solid tumor program, we have developed many patient-derived xenograft models and a number of PDX-derived cell lines. These unique models have been evaluated using genomic and functional approaches including (in some cases) treatment with conventional chemotherapy or investigational agents. Lastly, these samples were collected from a population that is among the most diverse in the nation and includes significant numbers of Asian, Latino, Indigenous and African-American patients, groups that are traditionally underrepresented in many banking efforts.","GRU","1","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs002430.v1.p1"

Each fully characterized case has gene expression, tumor and paired normal copy number analyses, methylation and comprehensive next-generation sequencing to include whole genome and/or whole exome sequencing. A majority of these cases will also have mRNA-seq and methylation data available as well.
